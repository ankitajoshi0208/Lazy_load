#  Experiment – 5  
## Lazy Loading using React.lazy and Suspense

###  Aim  
To implement lazy loading in React using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for performance optimization.

---

###  Objective  
- To perform component-based lazy loading  
- To perform route-based lazy loading  
- To achieve code splitting and reduce initial load time  

---

##  Implementation

### 🔹 Part 1 – Component Based Lazy Loading  
In this part, a component is loaded dynamically only when it is required (on user action).  
This prevents unnecessary loading during the initial render.


🔹 Part 2 – Route Based Lazy Loading

In this part, different pages are loaded only when the user navigates to a specific route using React Router.
